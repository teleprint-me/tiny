Description: A super simple transformer implementation.

Tiny is a super simple Transformer implementation for debugging Mini.

The Transformer model is actually rather simple in implementation. The complexity arises from the surrounding tooling and pipeline.

Tiny is designed to simplify that pipeline down to its core fundementals.
