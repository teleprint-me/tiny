# Tiny

Tiny is a super simple Transformer implementation for debugging [Mini](https://github.com/teleprint-me/mini.git).

The Transformer model is actually rather simple in implementation. The complexity arises from the surrounding tooling and pipeline.

Tiny is designed to simplify that pipeline down to its core fundementals.
